Textlocal SMS for Magento 2

This package allows you to integrate Textlocal SMS services into your Magento 2 store. In the helper file, I have created a function to send SMS requests to customers. If you wish to integrate other third-party SMS providers, you can make changes to this function, and it will work for all the events I have created.
